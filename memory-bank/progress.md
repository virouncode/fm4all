# Progress: FM4ALL Service Quotation Platform

## What Works

Based on the project structure and code examination, the following features appear to be implemented and functional:

1. **Core Application Structure**

   - Next.js application with App Router and internationalization
   - React Context-based state management system
   - Responsive layout with desktop and mobile components
   - Authentication system with role-based access

2. **Service Quotation Framework**

   - Multi-step quotation process with progress tracking
   - Service selection and configuration interface
   - Premises/location specification with surface area and occupancy
   - Real-time pricing calculations based on user selections

3. **Cleaning Services Module**

   - Complete service configuration options (standard, repasse, vitrerie)
   - Sophisticated pricing calculations with multiple variables
   - State management via NettoyageProvider
   - Real-time pricing updates through cache invalidation

4. **Cache Invalidation System**

   - Pusher integration for real-time updates
   - Cache invalidation listeners with debouncing and deduplication
   - Service-specific context updaters
   - Targeted data updates with minimal re-renders

5. **Supplier Management**

   - Supplier-facing tarifs update forms
   - Role-based access control for suppliers
   - Real-time propagation of price changes
   - Validation and error handling for pricing data

6. **Quote Management**
   - Quote initialization based on premises data
   - Quote reset functionality (partial and full)
   - State persistence via localStorage
   - Multi-service quote calculation

## What's Left to Build

Based on the current state, the following features may still need implementation or completion:

1. **Additional Service Modules**

   - Complete implementation of all service types
   - Ensure consistent user experience across services
   - Implement service-specific context updaters for all services
   - Extend cache invalidation to all service types

2. **Quote Finalization**

   - Quote summary view with detailed breakdown
   - PDF generation with professional formatting
   - Email delivery of quotes
   - Quote saving and retrieval

3. **User Account Management**

   - Enhanced profile management
   - Quote history and saved quotes
   - User preferences and settings
   - Role-based dashboards

4. **Admin Interface**

   - Comprehensive service configuration management
   - Pricing management and approval workflows
   - User management with role assignment
   - Quote monitoring and analytics

5. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - Usage statistics and conversion tracking
   - Performance metrics for quote generation
   - Supplier performance analytics
   - Business intelligence dashboards

## Current Status

The project is in active development with a focus on enhancing the pricing and quotation system. The core architecture is established, and the team is now implementing specific service modules, refining the cache invalidation system, and improving the user experience for real-time price updates.

### Development Priorities

1. **High Priority**

   - Complete the cache invalidation system for all services
   - Extend context updaters beyond the cleaning service
   - Finalize tarifs update forms for all service types
   - Implement comprehensive quote reset functionality

2. **Medium Priority**

   - Enhance the user interface for quote configuration
   - Improve performance of pricing calculations
   - Implement additional service modules
   - Develop quote summary and export functionality

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Admin interface for system management
   - Advanced analytics and reporting
   - Integration with external systems
   - Additional customization options

## Known Issues

Based on the current focus areas, potential known issues include:

1. **Cache Invalidation Challenges**

   - Potential race conditions in concurrent price updates
   - Handling offline scenarios and reconnection
   - Managing high-frequency update events
   - Ensuring consistent state across different browser tabs

2. **State Management Complexity**

   - Managing interdependencies between service modules
   - Preventing unnecessary re-renders with large state objects
   - Synchronizing localStorage with server state
   - Handling edge cases in quote reset functionality

3. **Quote Calculation Edge Cases**

   - Ensuring accurate calculations with partial data
   - Handling currency and decimal precision consistently
   - Managing calculation dependencies between services
   - Validating complex pricing rules

4. **Internationalization Issues**

   - Ensuring all content is properly translated
   - Handling language-specific formatting for numbers and currencies
   - Managing text expansion in different languages
   - Supporting right-to-left languages if needed

5. **Performance Concerns**
   - Real-time pricing calculations with complex formulas
   - Managing large state objects efficiently
   - Optimizing cache invalidation for multiple concurrent users
   - Ensuring responsive UI during intensive operations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As the project has evolved, several key decisions have shaped its development:

1. **Architecture Decisions**

   - Adoption of Next.js App Router with file-based routing
   - Use of React Context for state management instead of Redux
   - Implementation of real-time updates via Pusher
   - Service-specific context providers for better code organization

2. **User Experience Decisions**

   - Multi-step quotation process with clear navigation
   - Real-time pricing updates with user notifications
   - Service-specific configuration interfaces
   - Visual indicators for modified pricing data

3. **Technical Implementation Decisions**

   - Zod schemas for runtime validation
   - Server Actions for data mutations
   - Cache-first strategy with targeted invalidation
   - Context updaters for efficient state management

4. **Project Organization Decisions**
   - Feature-based file organization
   - Service-specific state providers
   - Separation of desktop and mobile components
   - Clear separation of concerns between UI, state, and actions

This document will be updated as the project progresses and more features are implemented or issues are resolved.
