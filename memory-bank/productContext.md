# Product Context: FM4ALL Service Quotation Platform

## Why This Project Exists

The FM4ALL platform exists to simplify and streamline the process of obtaining quotes for facility management services. Traditional methods of requesting quotes for such services often involve:

1. Multiple phone calls or emails to different service providers
2. Lengthy consultation processes
3. Difficulty in comparing options and prices
4. Lack of transparency in pricing structures
5. Delays in receiving final quotes

FM4ALL addresses these pain points by providing a digital platform where users can configure their service needs and receive transparent, immediate quotations.
